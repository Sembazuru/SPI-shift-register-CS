{"name":"Spi-shift-register-cs","tagline":"Circuit to use up to 8 or more devices on a SPI bus with only 2 chip select lines. Save I/O pins for other things!","body":"# SPI-shift-register-CS\r\nThe concept is to have a way of selecting many SPI devices without eating up an I/O pin for each device's chip select.\r\n\r\nUse a shift register chip to \"point to\" one of many SPI devices, and then use the SPI ~CS signal on the shift register's output enable pin for the SPI data communication.\r\n\r\nOne technique might be to shift a 1 the number of times equal to the position number of the desired device, then shift the one's complement out. Then proceed with the normal SPI transfer as normal using the shift register network's /OE pin as the SPI transfer ~CS pin.\r\n\r\nFor revision 1 try using MOSI and SCK to shift to the register. So only need 1 extra pin for the latch. Because the latch of 74HCT595 is rising edge triggered, add circuitry to change the MOSI line from pass-through with latch high to serial cascade with latch low. Essentially will act like a standard SPI ~CS pin for using SPI to shift the \"address\" of the target SPI device into the shift register.\r\n\r\n\r\nParts:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>74HC595 - Shift Register Single 8-Bit Serial to Serial/Parallel\r\n<ul><li>[Octopart link](https://octopart.com/search?q=74HC595&filter[fields][avg_avail][]=[1%20TO%20*]&view=matrix&filter[fields][specs.mounting_style.value][]=Through%20Hole)\r\n<li>Or any equivalent.
